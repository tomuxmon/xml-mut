# xml mut

xml mut (XML mutation) - a simple XML mutation definition language resembling SQL. Define your simple XML transformations the easy and readable way.

## Example

Lets say you have some simple XML, but you are still not happy and you would like to simplify it a bit more. In the bellow XML you know that `PackageReference` sub node's `Version` text could just be placed directly as an attribute of `PackageReference`. But you are too lazy to do it manually ðŸ˜’.

```xml
<Project>
    <ItemGroup>
        <PackageReference Include="System.Text.Json">
            <Version>7.0.2</Version>
        </PackageReference>
        <PackageReference Include="Mono.Cecil">
            <Version>0.11.4</Version>
        </PackageReference>
    </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

So instead you use xml-mut to do the work for you. You have seen some SQL in the past, and this task should be trivial. You brace yourself ðŸ’ª and write a simple XML mutation.

```sql
GET Project/ItemGroup/PackageReference
SET [@Version] = Version[text]
DELETE Version
```

Here we are saying we need to `get` xml node having a path of `Project`, `ItemGroup` and `PackageReference` (`PackageReference` node will be the target of the mutation). For that node we set `Version` attribute (`[@Version]`) with value from the `Version` sub node text (`Version[text]`). Since the `Version` sub node is no longer needed we delete it. Applying an XML mutation we get XML shown below ðŸ¥§.

```xml
<Project>
    <ItemGroup>
        <PackageReference Include="System.Text.Json" Version="7.0.2"/>
        <PackageReference Include="Mono.Cecil" Version="0.11.4"/>
    </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

Your eyes hurt much less looking into XML above ðŸ˜Ž.

## CLI Usage Example

When using CLI you need to suply a path to your XML mutation file. Next you decide if you want to specify XML files one by one and use [include command](#include-command) or scan the directory and use [scan command](#scan-command). if you need more help you can call with `--help` argument like shown below.

```bash
xml-mut-cli --help
```

### include command

You can consult how to use include command with a `help` call:

```bash
xml-mut-cli include --help
```

The usage is as follows:

```bash
xml-mut-cli <XML_MUT_PATH> include --xml-path <XML_PATH>
```

Here `<XML_MUT_PATH>` is a path to your XML mutation file. You can give it `.xmlmut` extension but it is not mandatory so far. `--xml-path` or `-x` argument can be repeated allowing you to include multiple XML files to be mutated. So a call could look something like this:

```bash
xml-mut-cli ~/packageref-version-fix.xmlmut include -x ~/code/My.Awsome.csproj -x ~/code/My.Awsome.Other.fsproj
```

### scan command

You can consult how to use `scan` command with a `help` call:

```bash
xml-mut-cli scan --help
```

The usage is as follows:

```bash
xml-mut-cli <XML_MUT_PATH> scan --extension <EXTENSION> <BASE_PATH>
```

Here `<XML_MUT_PATH>` is a path to your XML mutation file. You can give it `.xmlmut` extension but it is not mandatory so far. `--extension` or `-e` allows specifying what file extensions to include when scaning directory. You can specify multiple extensions. `<BASE_PATH>` defines a path you want to scan. So a call could look something like this:

```bash
xml-mut-cli ~/packageref-version-fix.xmlmut scan -e csproj -e fsproj ~/code
```

## Architexture

There are 4 crates so far. [xml-mut-data](xml-mut-data/) - is where all data structures of the XML mutation language reside. [xml-mut-parse](xml-mut-parse/) crate uses [nom](https://github.com/rust-bakery/nom) to parse XML mutation definition. [xml-mut-impl](xml-mut-impl/) uses [roxmltree](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/roxmltree) (read only xml tree) and extends it to be able to process XML with mutation definitions. [xml-mut-cli](xml-mut-cli/) uses [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) to combine both XML mutation parsing and read only xml extensions to process XML with mutation definitions. All of this is just in a proof of concept stage and will likely change in the future.

## Is it stable

it is still version `0.0.0`. But you can try it our and report any issues you had.
